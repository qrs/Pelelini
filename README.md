# About

Pelelini PHP & SASS framework and toolkit I created to kick off small projects.

My inspiration for this is to create a slight mix between [Bobby Giangeruso's][bobby] [Rudiment framework][rudiment] and [Brent Jackson's][brent] next-level [BASSCSS toolkit][basscss] to be suitable for my needs.

Feel free to ask for help via Twitter [@querln][me].
