Try and use BEM.

BEM is a methodology for naming and classifying CSS selectors in a way to make them a lot more strict, transparent and informative.

The naming convention follows this pattern:

.block {}
.block__element {}
.block--modifier {}

.block represents the higher level of an abstraction or component.
.block__element represents a descendent of .block that helps form .block as a whole.
.block--modifier represents a different state or version of .block.
An analogy of how BEM classes work might be:

.person {}
.person--woman {}
    .person__hand {}
    .person__hand--left {}
    .person__hand--right {}
